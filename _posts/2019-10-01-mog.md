Implementation of Stauffer-Grimson algorithm for background subtraction in C++ without using inbuilt functions. [pdf](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/vsam/Publications/stauffer_cvpr98_track.pdf). The algorithm models the distribution of each pixel as a **mixture of gaussians (MoG)** and updates it adaptively using an **online k-means approximation to Expectation Maximization (EM)**.
