I spent Summer 2019 at [Mitek Systems Inc.](https://www.miteksystems.com/) working with the document tooling team to improve document onboarding process and increase efficiency of modellers. The main projects that worked on were:
* Segmentation and four-corner detection of ID-documents
* Improved Image-Matcher Tool

## Segmentation and four-corner detection of ID-documents

I designed and developed a novel algorithm based on **U-Net architecture** for ID-document segmentation in natural scenes. This was followed by drawing a convex-hull, k-means clustering and IoU optimization to detect four-corners of the document. The algorithm achieved an **IoU of 0.98 for segmentation** and **median error of 7 pixels for four-corner detection**.

### Improved Image-Matcher Tool

I developed a complete pipeline incorporating automatic detection of ID-documents (described above) along with advanced compter vision algorithms for finding images of the same document type given a query image and a set of test images. The tool improved the legacy matcher by **rejecting over 92% of False positives** (FPs) while **retaining over 80% of True Positives** (TPs). I also designed an easy-to-use User Interface (UI) for the tool and successfully handed it over to the Document Modelling Team.
