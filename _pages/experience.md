**Machine Learning Intern**, Mitek Systems Inc. [*June 2019 - September 2019*]

I designed and developed an improved image matcher tool that significantly improved the document onboaring process and increased the efficiency of the modellers. I also developed a novel algorithm to segment and detect ID-documents in natural images. [Details](https://ijssaggu.github.io/mitek/)

**Graduate Researcher**, University of California, San Deigo [*November 2018 - Present*]

I am working on problem of collaborative autonomous perception. Given two or multiple agents equipped with cameras, how can we effectively combine information from the two views for improved scene-understanding, 3D geometry estimation and perception. [Lab Webpage](https://wcsng.github.io/wcsng/)

**Graduate Teaching Assistant**, ECE285: Machine Learning for Image Processing [*Spring 2019*]

Teaching Assistant for a graduate course that covered deep learning concepts and its applications in computer vision. Helped students with assignments in PyTorch. Designed a project on Style Transfer using Gatys original paper, Fei Fei Li's Real-time Style Transfer and Style Transfer using Cycle-GAN  [Course Website](https://www.charles-deledalle.fr/pages/teaching_ucsd_ece285_mlip_s2019.php)

**Research Intern**, SINAPSE, National University of Singapore [*May 2017 - August 2017*]

I spent Summer'17 as a Research Intern in the Neuromorphic Engineering and Robotics Group at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/)(NUS). I designed and fabricated a high density desktop tactile array (25600 taxels on 8′′x10′′) and used event-based encoding of pressure signals for high speed (5.2 kHz) and sparse acquisition. This neuromorphic representation of touch is well suited to rapid identification of critical contact events, making it suitable for dexterous manipulation in robotic and prosthetic applications.
