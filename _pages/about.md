I am a second-year Master's student at [University of California, San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), majoring in Machine Learning and Data Science. I plan to graduate in March 2020 and am actively looking for full-time opportunities for engineering and research roles in Machine Learning/Deep Learning.

My most recent experience was as a Machine Learning Intern at [Mitek Systems](https://www.miteksystems.com/) Inc., a global leader in digital identity verfication with clients ranging from [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Chase](https://www.chase.com/), [experian](https://www.experian.com/), [MoneyGram](https://www.moneygram.com/), [HyreCar](https://hyrecar.com) etc.

I worked with the Document Tooling team to design and develop a novel Image Matching tool that used deep learning and advanced computer vision algorithms to improve upon legacy tool by removing over 92% of False Positives. This improved the document onboarding process and increased the efficiency of the modellers. [Details](https://ijssaggu.github.io/mitek/)

I am also a graduate researcher working with Prof. Dinesh Bharadia on solving the challenging problem of Collaborative Perception between autonomous agents.
